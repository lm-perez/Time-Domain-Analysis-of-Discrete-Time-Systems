# Time-Domain-Analysis-of-Discrete-Time-Systems
In this lab, the concept of discrete time-signals was explored on MATLAB. In Part A, different discrete time signals were plotted and the changes in graphs after applying different transformations on different discrete plots was investigated. With that acquired knowledge sampling of discrete signals was then looked into. For Part B a system equation for a bank account with money being deposited and interest being added was derived. Then two plots were made showing what the account looked like in 12 months when no money is deposited compared to when $100 is deposited every month. In Part C, a filter is designed to find the maximum point of an input signal then displays the maximum point at the output. For Part D, two functions were made to calculate the energy and the power of a vector. Using the functions, the energy and power of the function x[n] was found.
